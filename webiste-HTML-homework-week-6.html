But, your code is fine, and it's very good to see your use of the alt attribute for accessibility img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/50/51/ab505151f51ca72dedb8ac1ac689b2cb.jpg=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142" -->
